        <h2>Start your day with a Espresso!</h2>
        <p>
            Come enjoy a freshly made cup of espresso based coffee, made with fair trade organic beans from around the
            world!
            Taste the variety and unique infusions that come with different roasting methods and the aroma of the
            brewing that will
            help jump start your day. Our coffee is ethically sourced and a percentage of our sales goes back to the
            farmers to help
